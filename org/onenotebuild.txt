Setup checklist
	1.	Create a new notebook named SOC Ops.
	2.	Add sections in this exact order:
	•	00-Inbox
	•	01-Active
	•	02-Incidents
	•	03-Detections
	•	04-Queries
	•	05-Playbooks
	•	06-Training
	•	07-Intel
	•	08-Reference
	•	99-Archive
	3.	Create these custom tags:
	•	[ACT] actionable
	•	[WAIT] pending or blocked
	•	[REF] stable reference
	•	[QUERY] runnable query
	•	[IOC] indicators present
	•	[TTP] technique notes
	•	[CHK] checklist step
	•	[COMM] stakeholder comms
	•	[TUNE] detection tuning
	•	[GAP] coverage gap
	4.	In 04-Queries, create subpages for the tools you actually use: Splunk, Chronicle, XSOAR, CrowdStrike, M365, Prisma.
	5.	Pin 01-Active to your OneNote Favorites bar. Keep it first.

⸻

Use during high stress
	•	Work only inside 01-Active during an incident. Do not spawn new pages.
	•	Dump anything transient into 00-Inbox. Do not sort in the moment.
	•	For queries, keep 04-Queries > 00-Common hunts to five entries. If a sixth is required, demote one.

Light maintenance cadence
	•	End of shift: move finished notes from 01-Active to 02-Incidents or 99-Archive.
	•	Weekly: prune 04-Queries, mark a single canonical per need as [REF].
	•	Monthly: sweep 00-Inbox and 03-Detections noise logs, update 99-Archive page.
