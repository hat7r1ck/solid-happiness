CASE REVIEW LIST - STUPID SIMPLE GUIDE

What you do
1) Open the workbook and save as .xlsm.
2) Put engineer names in Sheet2 column A starting at A2. One per row.
3) Load new data into Sheet1 using one of the two options below.
4) Press Alt+F8, pick BuildCaseReview, click Run. Or click the Refresh button if you added one.

Option A - append mode (preferred)
- In Sheet1, turn the data into a table one time: click any cell, press Ctrl+T, check “My table has headers”, OK. 
- With the table selected, Table Design, set Table Name to T_Raw.
- Next time you get a new export, paste it into the first empty row of T_Raw. The table will expand.
- Run BuildCaseReview.

Option B - overwrite mode
- In Sheet1, keep the header row in row 1.
- Paste the latest export directly under the header. Do not paste a second header row.
- Run BuildCaseReview.

What you get after Run
- De-duplicated by id. If the same id appears more than once, the row with the newest Closed Date wins.
- Rows where Manager equals Dbot are excluded.
- PriorityFlag: 1 means review first. 0 means normal.
- Closed Date shows real timestamps. Blank when missing or the source says “Still Open”.
- Columns D, E, F are interactive:
  - D: Senior Reviewer drop down, list comes from Sheet2 column A.
  - E: Determination drop down, choices are Additional Actions Required, Validated, Coaching, Exemplary.
  - F: Notes, free text.

Columns in Case Review List
A XSOAR_ID
B Case Owner
C Manager of Case Owner
D Senior Reviewer (drop down)
E Determination (drop down)
F Notes
G PriorityFlag
H Closed Date/Time (UTC)

Priority rules
- linkedCount equals 0, or
- name starts with INV, or
- type equals Manual, or
- type equals Parent.

What persists across runs
- Reviewer fields and notes in columns D, E, F are saved by Case ID in a hidden sheet named InputsStore. Your selections come back even if the row disappears and returns later.
- Core fields per Case ID are saved in a hidden sheet named PersistStore. IDs do not drop from the output when you overwrite Sheet1 with a smaller export. They return on every run unless Manager is Dbot which remains excluded in the visible list.

Formatting behavior
- Your column widths and conditional formatting in Case Review List are preserved. The macro does not wipe formats.
- Dates in column H are formatted as m/d/yy h:mm AM/PM. Blank if the date is missing or “Still Open”.

One time optional
- Add a button: Developer tab, Insert, Form Controls, Button. Assign macro BuildCaseReview. Label it Refresh.

Troubleshooting - quick
- Nothing happens or a warning shows about headers:
  Make sure Sheet1 or T_Raw has these headers exactly: id, owner, Manager, linkedCount, name, type, Closed Date/Time (UTC).
- Reviewer drop down empty:
  Fill Sheet2 column A with names starting at A2.
- Dates sort oddly or show as text:
  That column is already formatted. If your raw export uses unusual text dates, just run again. The parser handles US dates like 8/1/25 1:50 AM and ISO forms. Missing dates show as blank by design.

Daily use reminder
- Append to the T_Raw table or paste under the Sheet1 header, then run BuildCaseReview. Do not paste a second header. Use the two drop downs and Notes. Your inputs will be there next time.
