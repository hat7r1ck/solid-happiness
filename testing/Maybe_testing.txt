“Validated Entra sign-in telemetry for IP 185.253.98.86 and errorCode 50074 tied to Pluralsight Learning. Four log rows were observed across ~15 seconds, all share the same CorrelationId (47fdf833-9ce9-486c-80…), and reflect endpoint-level calls (SAS:EndAuth, DeviceAuth:ReprocessTls) within a single interactive authentication sequence, not repeated MFA prompts. Conditional Access enforced phish-resistant MFA and the user successfully authenticated. Authenticator device is pre-existing and app access is assigned. Activity aligns with an India-based user using a common consumer VPN from a personal device to access training. Entity threshold breach was driven by stacked risk contributions (generic MDI mapping plus WF2025.2774 fatigue scoring). Enhancement request submitted to review fatigue logic to count distinct auth transactions (CorrelationId) vs raw rows. Closing as False Positive for metrics.”
