can verify that specific case, but one outlier does not skew an entire year of data. The trend is consistent month over month.
The Reality:
1. Queue Latency: We consistently miss the 30-minute pickup target by hours. Cases sit stale for a day before anyone can touch them.
2. High Fidelity Workload: Our False Positive Rate is under 5%. The team is fighting real fires, not noise.
3. Efficiency: Once we actually engage, we resolve tickets within the 25-hour target.
Conclusion:
The team is efficient but maxed out. We do not have a performance issue. We have a capacity issue. The data shows a team that is redlining
