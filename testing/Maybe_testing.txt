Disposition: False Positive

Rationale:
Reviewed Entra ID Protection “Anonymous IP address” alert tied to Pluralsight Learning access. Conditional Access enforced MFA and the sign-in succeeded. The Authenticator device is pre-existing and there is no indication of new device registration or suspicious authentication behavior. Activity is consistent with a user based in India using a common consumer VPN (Proton/VPN exit IP) from a personal device to access an assigned training application with corporate credentials. No indicators of compromise observed.

Why the case exceeded threshold:
Entity risk threshold was exceeded due to stacked risk contributions from a vendor alert risk mapping plus the Splunk rule WF2025.2774.RC.Azure_AD_Possible_MFA_Fatigue_Attack contributing score in a scenario that does not reflect MFA fatigue (single event context).

Follow-up action:
Submitted enhancement request to content team to address rule logic/scoring behavior. Enhancement ticket: [TICKET-####] (populate in case tracking field). Case closed after ticket submission and documentation updates completed.
